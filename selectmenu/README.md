# Open UI's `<selectmenu>` demos

➡️ **[Open the demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/selectmenu/)** ⬅️

The purpose of [Open UI](https://open-ui.org/) is to provide the web platform with UI controls that can be styled and extended by web developers.

Open UI is working on [a specification of a new `<select>` element](https://open-ui.org/components/selectmenu/) and it is being [prototyped in Chromium](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5737365999976448) by the Microsoft Edge team.

The [demos](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/selectmenu/) in this folder show how this prototype can currently be used to achieve what was once only possible with custom (and often inaccessible) selects.

**Note:** the experimental `<selectmenu>` control allows web developers to go very far in extending the default control. They can in fact replace the entire shadow DOM of the control and introduce their own, with extra elements inside and around the various button, listbox, and options parts. The demos in this folder use this to push the prototype to its limits, but as a result introduces sometimes inaccessible use cases. **These are currently serving as a way to provoke discussions aimed at evolving the specification and implementation. They should not be taken as examples of what to do with the new `<selectmenu>` element.**
