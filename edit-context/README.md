# EditContext API: HTML editor demo

➡️ **[Open the demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/edit-context/)** ⬅️

The **EditContext** API can be used to build rich text editors on the web that support advanced text input experiences, such as IME (Input Method Editor) composition, emoji picker, or any other platform-specific editing-related UI surfaces.

With the EditContext API, you get the flexibility to render your own editable text region using any technology you want.

This demo is a simple HTML text editor that uses the EditContext API to allow entering HTML code. The HTML code appears highlighted, with tags, attributes, and text content in different colors. IME composition and emoji picker are also supported and appear in the right place.
