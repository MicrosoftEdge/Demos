[➡️Open demo app here⬅️](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/pwa-background-sync/)

> **Note:** to test the demo app, first install it by clicking the **App available** button in the address bar of Microsoft Edge, and then open the installed app in its own window.

The Background Sync API makes it possible for users to continue using your PWA even when they are offline, and synchronize data with the server once the network connection is restored.

See [Use the Background Sync API to synchronize data with the server](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps/how-to/background-syncs#use-the-background-sync-api-to-synchronize-data-with-the-server).
