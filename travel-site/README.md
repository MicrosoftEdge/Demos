This fictitious travel website is used as a low performance demo page in the Microsoft Edge DevTools tutorial: [Optimize website speed using Lighthouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/speed/get-started).

## About the demo

The demo website is used to demonstrate how to optimize a webpage's resources to make it load, appear, and be interactive faster. Therefore, the website has low performance by design.

Note that the demo website consists of a single webpage and the links on the page do not lead anywhere.
