➡️ **[Open the demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/pwa-installer/)** ⬅️

**PWA installer** is a demo app for a landing page that lets you install PWAs from a collection of applications.  This demo app showcases the Web Install API.

## Requirements

For the demo to work correctly, you must enable a flag, which is available in browsers based on Chromium, such as Microsoft Edge, starting with version 139.

To enable the flag:

1. In the browser, open a new tab and go to `about:flags`.

   In Microsoft Edge, you end up at `edge://flags`.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **web-app-installation-api**.

1. Set the **Web App Installation API** flag to **Enabled**.

1. Click the **Restart** button in the lower right.  The browser restarts.

1. In the same browser, go to [https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/pwa-installer/](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/pwa-installer/) or your localhost equivalent.

This demo also makes use of CSS masonry layout, as a progressive enhancement.  You can optionally enable the CSS masonry flag:

1. In the browser, open a new tab and go to `about:flags`.

   In Microsoft Edge, you end up at `edge://flags`.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **css-masonry-layout**.

1. Set the **CSS Masonry Layout** flag to **Enabled**.

1. Click the **Restart** button in the lower right.  The browser restarts.
