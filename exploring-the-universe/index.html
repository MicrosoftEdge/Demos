      <p>The universe is vast, mysterious, and full of wonders waiting to be discovered. From the moment we first looked
        up at the night sky, humanity has been driven by an insatiable curiosity to explore the cosmos. Every star,
        planet, and galaxy holds the potential for new knowledge, new frontiers, and new insights into the fundamental
        nature of our existence. As we journey through the stars, we venture into the unknown, unraveling the secrets of
        the universe one discovery at a time.</p>
      <p>Our journey begins with the simple yet profound question: What lies beyond our world? With each new leap in
        technology and science, we expand our ability to observe distant planets, analyze ancient starlight, and peer
        deeper into the fabric of space itself. The universe is a vast, ever-expanding frontier, and every step we take
        brings us closer to understanding the forces that govern the cosmos.</p>
      <p>As we explore further, we realize that this journey is not just about reaching new destinations, but about the
        connections we make — between the stars, between the planets, and ultimately, between ourselves and the greater
        universe. Each discovery brings us closer to understanding our place in the cosmos, and with each new question,
        the universe opens up new pathways to explore. Join us as we embark on this endless adventure, where the wonders
        of the universe are waiting to be explored.</p>

        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Precession of the Equinoxes (162-127 BC)</h3>
          <p>Hipparchus discovered the precession of the equinoxes, by measuring the longitude of the star Spica and 
            comparing previous measurements. He determined that the equinoxes move through the zodiac by around 1° per 
            century, and invented the astrolabe and armillary sphere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Heliocentric Theory (1543)</h3>
          <p>Nicolaus Copernicus proposed that the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, challenging the long-held
            geocentric model where Earth was believed to be at the center. This discovery laid the foundation for modern
            astronomy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Laws of Planetary Motion (1609-1619)</h3>
          <p>Johannes Kepler formulated the three laws of planetary motion, which revolutionized our understanding of
            how planets move around the Sun. Kepler's laws were essential for Newton's later work on gravity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Universal Gravitation (1687)</h3>
          <p>Isaac Newton published the "Principia," where he formulated the law of universal gravitation, showing that 
            every object in the universe exerts an attractive force on every other object. This discovery explained
            planetary motion and laid the groundwork for classical physics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>The Milky Way is Just One Galaxy (1920)</h3>
          <p>Through the work of astronomers like Edwin Hubble, we learned that the Milky Way is just one of billions 
            of galaxies in the universe. This discovery expanded our understanding of the size and structure of the 
            universe.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Expanding Universe (1929)</h3>
          <p>Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving away from each other, implying that the universe itself 
            is expanding. This finding provided key evidence for the Big Bang theory and reshaped our understanding
            of the universe's origin.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (1965)</h3>
          <p>Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background radiation, a faint glow left over 
            from the Big Bang. This discovery provided strong evidence supporting the Big Bang theory of the universe's 
            origin.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Black Holes (1964)</h3>
          <p>Through X-ray observations, astronomers discovered strong evidence for the existence of black holes — 
            regions of space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. These exotic objects are now
            understood to play a significant role in the formation of galaxies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Expanding Universe and Dark Energy (1998)</h3>
          <p>Two independent teams of astronomers discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, driven 
            by an unknown force called dark energy. This discovery altered our understanding of the cosmos and pointed 
            to the presence of a mysterious energy that makes up most of the universe's content.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Exoplanets (1992)</h3>
          <p>The first exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star was discovered by astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale 
            Frail. Since then, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, expanding our knowledge of the diversity 
            of planetary systems in the universe.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <h3>Gravitational Waves (2015)</h3>
          <p>The LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) collaboration detected gravitational waves 
            for the first time, ripples in space-time caused by violent cosmic events like merging black holes. This 
            discovery opened a new way to observe the universe.</p>
